# Offline Data Processing and Standardization Application

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an offline desktop application that helps users preprocess and standardize structured and semi-structured tabular datasets such as CSV and Excel files. The system uses rule-based detection techniques to analyze dataset columns and suggests suitable data types, which are confirmed by the user before applying transformations.

Core preprocessing tasks such as duplicate removal, missing value handling, data type correction, and column restructuring can be performed through a simple, user-friendly interface without requiring any programming knowledge. Since all processing happens locally, the application ensures data privacy and security.

## Tech Stack

1. Python
   Used as the primary programming language for implementing data processing logic and application control.
2. Pandas
   Used for handling, cleaning, and transforming tabular datasets efficiently.
3. Tkinter
   Used to build the initial desktop graphical user interface for file selection, previews, and user interactions.
4. Regular Expressions (re module)
   Used for rule-based column type detection such as emails, phone numbers, and dates.
5. Git & Github
   Used for version control and our team collaboration.

## We will be performing individual tasks which will sum upto the Phase we will be working currently on. When we all finish, we'll go into the next Phase

## Phase 1: Initial Development Tasks

The first phase focuses on building the core foundation (core engine) of the application. The combined tasks include:

- Designing a modular project structure
- Implementing data loading functionality for CSV and Excel files
- Maintaining application state/version (original and modified datasets)
- Implementing core preprocessing functions:
  - duplicate removal
  - missing value handling
  - basic data type standardization
- Implementing rule-based column type detection (suggestion-based)
- Creating a basic Tkinter interface for:
  - file upload
  - data preview
  - preprocessing actions
  - exporting cleaned data

This phase aims to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates the core capabilities of the system.
